index.php?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
After submitting this request, the application returned the flag.
This demonstrates that the page parameter is directly used to include files from the server without proper validation.
By using directory traversal sequences (../), it was possible to move outside the intended directory and access a sensitive system file.
The application accepts user input in the page parameter.
That value is used to load or include a file on the server.
No restriction prevents navigating to parent directories.
Sensitive system files such as /etc/passwd become accessible.
HOW TO PREVENT THIS:
Never use raw user input to construct file paths.
Implement a strict allowlist of permitted files.
Resolve and validate paths to ensure they stay within an intended directory.
Disable dangerous configurations (e.g., allow_url_include in PHP).
