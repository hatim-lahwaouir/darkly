curl -v -X POST "http://10.11.100.224/index.php?page=recover" --data "mail=test@test.com&Submit=submit" | grep "The flag is"
After submitting this request, the application returned the flag.
The recover page accepts an email address in the mail parameter.
The server processes user-supplied input in a sensitive operation.
No validation or escaping of input occurs.
The input directly affects command execution .
This allowed showing of the flag through the normal request by manipulating input parameters.
HOW TO PREVENT THIS :
Never pass raw user input to system commands.
Validate all user input strictly.
Escape all arguments if commands must be executed.
Run services with minimal privileges.
