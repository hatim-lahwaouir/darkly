when checking the application and cookies there is a cookie named i_am_admin and it shows a crypted value like this 68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327 
By modifying the cookie value to represent true and refreshing the page, the application granted administrative access and displayed the flag.
The application is making an authorization decision based on a client-controlled cookie.
The server is trusting a value stored in the browser to determine whether the user is an administrator.
Anything stored in the browser can be modified by the user.
Authorization logic depends on client-side data.
No server-side validation of admin privileges.
HOW TO PREVENT THIS :
Store roles and permissions in the database.
Use session identifiers only in cookies.
Validate privileges on every request.
