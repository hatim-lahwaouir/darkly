On the feedback page, there is a textarea field where users can submit a message.
When the following payload was inserted into the message field:
<script>let i = 0 ; </script>
The application accepted it and, after submission, displayed the flag.
The application allowed raw HTML/JavaScript code to be submitted and processed without filtering or escaping it.
When a website takes user input and renders it in the browser without properly sanitizing it, injected JavaScript can execute inside the page.
This vulnerability is called Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
the application does not sanitize user input before displaying it.
User input is accepted without validation.
Output is rendered without proper escaping.
The application trusts client input and directly reflects it in HTML.


HOW TO PREVENT THIS:

Escape all user-generated content before displaying it in HTML.
Sanitize inputs if HTML formatting is allowed.
Mark cookies as HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite.
