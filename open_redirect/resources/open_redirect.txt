While checking the links in the footer of the page, the link looked like this:  href="index.php?page=redirect&site=facebook"
This means the page uses a parameter called site to decide where the user will be redirected.To test it, the value facebook was changed to google:
href="index.php?page=redirect&site=google"
After changing the value, the application redirected differently and shows the flag.
This confirms that the redirect destination is controlled directly by user input.
The application trusts the site parameter without properly checking it. Because of this, anyone can modify the value in the URL and control where the redirection goes.
This is called Open Redirect.
The server does not properly validate or restrict the value of the site parameter before performing the redirect.

HOW TO PREVENT THIS:
Do not allow users to provide full redirect URLs.
use a whitelist of allowed URLs.
Validate and sanitize all redirect parameters on the server side.
