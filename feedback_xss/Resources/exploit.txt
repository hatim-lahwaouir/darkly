|- the endpoint for stroing feedback is /?page=feedback
|- takes a post body  txtName=<img src=x onerror=alert(1337)>&mtxtMessage=<img src=x onerror=alert(1337)>&btnSign=Sign+Guestbook
|- The problem here is the input is not validated and sanitized inserted directry into the dom
|- plus there is no CSP (content security policy) as a layer of protection
|- just inserting a script in both textName and mtx attribute you will get the flag
