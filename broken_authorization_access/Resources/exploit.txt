|---+ based on comment in the source code
|   |
|   |- You must come from : "https://www.nsa.gov/". -> here we can use the Referer header 
|   |- Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot. -> here we can use the User-agent header
|   
|---+ understanding the headers
|   |
|   |
|   |- user-agent: tells the server from which browser the request was originated plus it' s a user controlled input
|   |- referer:  tells the server from where the request was originated and also it a user controlled input
|
|---+ problem here
|   |
|   |- trusting user input
|   |- comments from source code in production
|___|- authorization based on headers without authentication  


+ to prevent
|
|- always authenticate user if you want him to get access to some data 
|- always check user state in the backend before doing any action  to check if he got the right permissions
